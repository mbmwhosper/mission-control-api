# 🚀 MISSION CONTROL V3 — LIVE RIGHT NOW

Your backend is **100% live** and responding. GitHub Pages is still building (takes 1-2 min).

---

## 🌍 ACCESS YOUR DASHBOARD NOW

### **Option 1: Local File (Instant)**

Open this in your browser (works right now):
```
file:///home/c/.openclaw/workspace/mission-control-v3/public/index.html
```

This connects to your ngrok tunnel automatically.

---

### **Option 2: Via ngrok Frontend**

I'm serving the frontend directly from ngrok:

```
https://unmultiplicative-will-nonsensible.ngrok-free.dev
```

Open this and your dashboard appears (might take 30 seconds to load first time).

---

### **Option 3: GitHub Pages (Give it 2 more minutes)**

```
https://mbmwhosper.github.io/mission-control-v3
```

Still building. Will be live shortly.
